#+TITLE: TODO  list

* TODO Improve documentation
  Mathematica package doc: code snippet examples for each function
* TODO Maybe use a more recent Matheematica version (10 or 11)
  - dictionary structure will allow to simplify code related to option management
  - availability of *RLink* for a smooth integration of R and RObject export (idea from Jeff Patterson)
* TODO Support parallel sampling (with process id, see CmdStan doc)
